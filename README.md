# Custom Compose Buttons with Extended Functionality

This repository offers a set of custom button components for Jetpack Compose that enhance the standard Compose `Button` component by introducing support for both regular clicks (`onClick`) and long clicks (`onLongClick`). These buttons are highly customizable and can be effortlessly integrated into your Compose-based projects.

## Features

- **`DCButton`**: A customizable button with regular click and long-click support.
- **`DCElevatedButton`**: An elevated button with regular click and long-click support.
- **`DCFilledTonalButton`**: A filled tonal button with regular click and long-click support.
- **`DCOutlinedButton`**: An outlined button with regular click and long-click support.
- **`DCTextButton`**: A text button with regular click and long-click support.

## Installation

To use these custom button components in your Compose project, follow these steps:

1. Open your project's `build.gradle` file and ensure you have the Compose dependencies included:

```
dependencies {
    // ...
    implementation(platform("androidx.compose:compose-bom:$compose_bom_version"))
    implementation("androidx.compose.ui:ui")
    implementation("androidx.compose.ui:ui-graphics")
    implementation("androidx.compose.ui:ui-tooling-preview")
    implementation("androidx.compose.material3:material3")
    // ...
}
```

Replace `$compose_bom_version` with the version of Compose bom you are using.

2. Copy the custom button components (`DCButton.kt`, `DCElevatedButton.kt`, `DCFilledTonalButton.kt`, `DCOutlinedButton.kt`, and `DCTextButton.kt`) into your project's source directory, placing them in a package that aligns with your project's structure.

## Usage

You can use these custom button components just like standard Compose `Button` components. The key difference is that they support both regular clicks and long clicks. Here's an example of how to use them:

```
import com.gkcoding.composebuttoncomponents.component.*

// ...

Column {
    DCButton(
        onClick = { /* Handle regular click event */ },
        onLongClick = { /* Handle long-click event */ }
    ) {
        Text(text = "DCButton")
    }

    DCElevatedButton(
        onClick = { /* Handle regular click event */ },
        onLongClick = { /* Handle long-click event */ }
    ) {
        Text(text = "DCElevatedButton")
    }

    DCFilledTonalButton(
        onClick = { /* Handle regular click event */ },
        onLongClick = { /* Handle long-click event */ }
    ) {
        Text(text = "DCFilledTonalButton")
    }

    DCOutlinedButton(
        onClick = { /* Handle regular click event */ },
        onLongClick = { /* Handle long-click event */ }
    ) {
        Text(text = "DCOutlinedButton")
    }

    DCTextButton(
        onClick = { /* Handle regular click event */ },
        onLongClick = { /* Handle long-click event */ }
    ) {
        Text(text = "DCTextButton")
    }
}
```

In this example, we've created a `Column` that contains instances of each custom button component. For each button, we've provided both `onClick` and `onLongClick` event handlers. These event handlers allow you to define specific actions or behaviors for regular clicks and long clicks on the buttons.

## Customization

These custom button components offer extensive customization options:

- `shape`: Customize the button's shape.
- `colors`: Customize the button's colors.
- `elevation`: Customize the button's elevation for different states.
- `border`: Customize the button's border.
- `contentPadding`: Customize the content padding within the button.
- `enabled`: Control whether the button is enabled or disabled.

Feel free to tailor these properties to match your project's design and requirements.
